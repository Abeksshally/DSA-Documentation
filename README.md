# DSA-Documentation

This is where I started my portfolio buillding while taking my Data Analysis class with Incubator Hub

📊 My Data Analysis Journey – DSA Bootcamp
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This repository documents my journey over the last three months as a participant in the Data Analysis Bootcamp by DSA. As someone who came into this world of data with little to no experience, this bootcamp has truly transformed my understanding and given me a solid foundation in data analysis.

🚀 Overview of My Journey
Week 1–2: Orientation and Tech Mastery
The journey began with introductory classes on tech mastery. We were introduced to the facilitators, the platforms we’d be using (like Canva LMS, GitHub, Power BI, and SQL tools), and the expectations of the program.

📊 Week 3–5: Excel for Data Analysis
We dove into Excel and explored the fundamentals of spreadsheet data analysis. Some of the key areas covered include:

Basic Functions: SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, COUNTIF, SUMIFS, etc.

Data Cleaning & Trimming: Functions like TRIM, PROPER, CONCATENATE helped us clean and organize messy datasets.

Lookup Functions: We focused mainly on VLOOKUP for retrieving information from large data tables.

Pivot Tables & Dashboards: We were shown how to build pivot tables and design dashboards for summarizing data.

🗄️ Week 6–8: SQL for Data Management
The next big leap was learning SQL Management Studio, a tool I had never encountered before the bootcamp. It was both challenging and eye-opening. Here’s what we covered:

Installation & Navigation of SQL Server.

Understanding SQL: What it is, its uses, and the types (DDL, DML, DCL, etc.).

Creating Databases & Tables from scratch.

Keys: Primary Key, Foreign Key, and Unique Key (Primary Key resonated the most with me).

Joins: Inner Join, Outer Join, Left Join, etc.

Data Manipulation: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE, DROP.

Aggregation & Queries: Using GROUP BY, COUNT, AVG, etc.

Advanced SQL: Using CASE WHEN, creating VIEWS.

We also had our first LMS assessment, where I scored a good grade, reinforcing my growing confidence.

🧠 Week 9–11: GitHub & Portfolio Building
We were guided on how to create and use GitHub effectively to build our individual portfolios. This marked the start of showcasing our project works online for the world to see.

📊 Week 12–14: Power BI Visualization
Our Power BI lessons focused on real-time business dashboards and data visualization techniques. We learnt:

Installing and navigating Power BI Desktop.

Power Query: For cleaning and transforming data.

Data Modeling: Creating relationships between tables.

DAX Functions: Writing calculated columns and measures.

Visualization: Using appropriate charts and graphs to tell a story with data.

We completed another assessment before the final phase.

🧩 Final Phase: Capstone Project
We were given three case studies and asked to pick any two to demonstrate what we’ve learned. I chose:

Amazon Product Review Analysis (Excel-based)

Kultra Mega Stores Inventory (KMS) (SQL-based)

These projects involved real-world scenarios where I had to analyze large datasets, extract meaningful insights, and present them in a way that supports informed decision-making.

📂 The analysis files and documentation are available in my repositories here on.

🎯 Challenges & Growth
This journey has been anything but easy; from unstable power supply to expensive data subscriptions, plus trying to grasp new and technical concepts as someone new to this aspect of tech. There were moments I felt overwhelmed, but thanks to:

God

Myself

Colleagues, family & friends who supported and encouraged me

…I was able to meet the project deadline and successfully complete this phase of the bootcamp. The experience has not only taught me technical skills, but also resilience, time management, and collaboration.

🙌 What’s Next?
As I continue learning, I hope to improve my proficiency in data analytics tools and become more confident in tackling complex datasets. I’m eager to:

Work on more personal projects

Collaborate with other analysts

Eventually take up roles that involve data-driven decision-making

📬 Thank You!
Thank you for taking the time to read about my journey. Feel free to explore the case studies and projects in this repository. Feedback and collaboration opportunities are welcome!
